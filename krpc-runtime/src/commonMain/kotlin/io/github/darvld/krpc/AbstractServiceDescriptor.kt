 * Descriptors are helper classes holding a service's method descriptors, transcoders, and other necessary
 * information.
 *
 * This class is not intended for general use, since the kRPC compiler will generate a custom descriptor for
 * every defined service. However, you may need descriptor instances when creating custom server/client implementations
 * in order to provide all the necessary information to the lower-level API.
